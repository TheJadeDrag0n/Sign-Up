						<span class="card-title">Acts 1:1-5</span>
						<p>In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do 
						and to teach until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions 
						through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. After his suffering, he 
						presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He 
						appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. 
						On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: “Do 
						not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard
						me speak about. For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be 
						baptized with the Holy Spirit.”</p>
